# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## There will be code

Specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is _programming_.\
Such a specification is _code_.

## Bad code

It was the bad code that brought the company down.

_Later equals never_.

## The total cost of owning a mess

##  The Grand Redesign in the Sky

Management will not replace the old system until the new system can do everything that the old system does. The race between two teams can go on for a very long time. I've seen it take 10 years.

_Then you already know that spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it's a matter of professional survival_.

## Attitude

It's your job to defend the code with equal passion.

So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes.

##  The Primal Conundrum

They don't take the time to go fast!

Keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

##  The boy scout rule
_The code has to be kept clean over time_

BOY SCOUTS __RULE__: Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

Adapt: :warning:_"Try and leave this world a little better than you found it ... "_:warning:

##  Prequel and Principles

:books: _Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices (PPP)._

##  Conclusion

Books on art don't promise to make you an artist.\
"PRACTICE, SON. PRACTICE!"
